* My name is Haoyang (pronounced as "How Yeung"). I am currently a PhD student at the [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME), [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), advised by Prof. [Guang Lin](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~lin491/).

* My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, dynamical systems, and computational physics. I harness the analytical capabilities of differential equations — including ODEs, PDEs, and SDEs — to address complex challenges in machine learning.
