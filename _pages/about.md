I am currently a PhD student at the school of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University, advised by Prof. [Guang Lin](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~lin491/).

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, dynamical systems, and computational physics. He harnesses the analytical strengths of ODEs, PDEs, and SDEs to tackle intricate machine-learning challenges.
