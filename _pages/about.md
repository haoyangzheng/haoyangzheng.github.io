My name is Haoyang (pronounced as "Hau Yeung"). I am currently a PhD candidate at the [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME), [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), advised by Prof. [Guang Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7lWVV2IAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research topics lie at the intersection of machine learning, dynamical systems, and computational physics. I focus on the use of computational and analytical tools from differential equations — including ODEs, PDEs, and SDEs — to address complex challenges in machine learning.
