I am currently a PhD student at the school of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University, advised by Prof. [Guang Lin](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~lin491/).

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, dynamical systems, and computational physics. I use the analytical strengths of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), partial differential equations (PDEs), and stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to tackle intricate machine-learning challenges.
