<strong>Abstract:</strong>
Many relations in the real world can be described by mathematical language. Fuzzy set theory can transform human language into mathematical language and use membership degree function to describe relations between events. Dempster–Shafer evidence theory provides basic probability assignment (BPA), which can describe the occurrence rate of attributes in basic events. Based on the known membership degree function and BPA distribution, a new evaluation method is proposed in this paper to analyze decision making. Given the relations among relevant events, which are expressed by BPA distribution and membership degree function, the relations among basic events and top event can be obtained. The Dempster's combination rule and pignistic probability transformation are used to transform BPA distribution into probability distribution. The belief measure is applied to deal with these fuzzy relations. Some numerical examples are given in this paper to illustrate the proposed evaluation methodology.
